# Not 2 Much SE and AI 

<img align=right src="/docs/img/not2much.png" width=400>

If they do it for $100, can you do it for a cent?

Say someone wants an AI to watch and help people work. Do you:

- Spin up a massive cloud LLM, wrapped in layers of JavaScript?
- Pay endlessly for licenses, CPU, and storage?
- Lock yourself into a black-box model no one can really edit?
- Retrain everything just to tweak a tiny rule?

Or, do you:

- Build it with not2much SE and AI, using jsut a few hundred lines of code;
- Using code you can understand with costs you control;
- And results that just work?

Interested? Then read on!


## Who should read this

This is an SE and AI training toolkit for newbies, guiding them to a cheaper simpler fast way to approach Se and AI. 

No, this does not handle generation (yet). But it does do classification, regressions, clustering, optimziation, explantion, planning, etc, etc, etc. 

Experienced AI people might enjoy [motivation](/docs/motives.md), then jump straight to [ai](/docs/a.md) and  [apps](/docs/apps.md).
