# How hard is AI? Can we make it simpler?

<img align=right src="/docs/img/not2much.png" width=300>

**Not2much** is a tiny AI toolkit — just a few hundred lines of Python — that delivers explainable AI, fast multi-objective optimization, active learning, clustering, decision trees, Bayes classifiers, and more.

No AI background? No problem. If you know a little Python, you can learn real AI here.

Already an expert? Here's your challenge:

> If they build it for $100, can you do it for a cent?

When someone needs AI to help their team, do you:

- Fire up a giant cloud LLM wrapped in bloated JavaScript?  
- Burn money on compute, storage, and licensing?  
- Retrain a black box just to tweak one rule?

Or do you:

- Write a few hundred lines of readable, adaptable code,  
- That runs fast, costs little, and just works?

**That’s not2much SE for AI.**

Ready? Let’s go.

    No, this code doesn’t do generation (yet).
      <br><br>
      But it <strong>does</strong> handle classification, regression, clustering, optimization, explanation, planning, text mining, etc, etc — all in a few hundred lines.
