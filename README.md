# Not 2 Much SE for AI 

<img align=right src="/docs/img/not2much.png" width=350>

If they do it for $100, can you do it for a cent?

Say someone wants an AI to watch and help people work. Do you:

- Spin up a massive cloud LLM, wrapped in layers of JavaScript?
- Pay endlessly for licenses, CPU, and storage?
- Lock yourself into a black-box model no one can really edit?
- Retrain everything just to tweak a tiny rule?

Or, do you:

- Build it with not2much SE and AI, using jsut a few hundred lines of code;
- Using code you can understand with costs you control;
- And get results that just work, with no  overhead?

Interested? Then read on!

      This is a tiny toolkit for  SE for AI newcomers who know a bit of Python. It offers a faster, cheaper, simpler way to get started — no AI theory required.

      No, this doesn’t do generation (yet).
      <br><br>
      But it <strong>does</strong> handle classification, regression, clustering, optimization, explanation, planning, text mining, etc, etc — all in a few hundred lines.
