## Don’t Just Code — Cut

Surgeons don’t learn by turning their back on the patient to Google a solution.  
Sure, they do research. They study. They ask for help.  
But they also reach in—with care, with training—to feel the problem for themselves.  
They learn their tools not by reading about them, but by using them under pressure.

That hands-on experience teaches them how to:

- Recognize edge cases  
- Design new techniques  
- Balance competing risks in real time  

It’s not about **getting it right the first time**.  
It’s about **learning fast**, **testing constantly**, and adjusting to what reality throws at you.

The same applies to coding.

- Your job isn’t just to click “run” and move on.  
- Your job is to **test it**, **stress it**, **question it**.  
- You’re not just completing tasks—**you’re maturing your understanding** of the problem.

Because as Karl Popper says:
_“Knowledge grows through bold guesses and the courage to break them.”_ .
So:

> What survives **criticism**, not confirmation, is what we can trust.


Which means:

>  **Don’t just code — challenge**  

>  **Don’t just build — break**  

>  **Don’t just accept — refute**


To become an expert, you don’t avoid mistakes.  Instead you mist

>  **Make mistables faster** —then learn from what breaks.


## What does this have to do with AI?

This is  how you stay human in the loop—even with a bot at your side.
